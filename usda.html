Overview
For the purposes of this class project I focused on a redesign of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The purpose of the USDA is to provide resources about agriculture health and care, disaster relief efforts, provide information about legislation to farmers, as well as a myriad of different topics.  The primary goal of the project was to find a method to better organize the information that was available on the USDA site because the number of topics covered and information conveyed was immense.
Team Size + Role & Responsibility
The purpose of this project was just myself doing the ux/ui testing and research of the project.  I studied the USDA.gov website at length, created a card-sort of the website, and tried to organize the information into a more sensible, intuitive, and digestible distribution of the USDA information.  I also focused on a visual redesign of the website structure via Adobe XD, for the purpose of making the website updated and appealing to modern expectations of visual standards.
Timeline & Scope 
There was a two week timeline for this project and $0 for budget.  Apart from this being a class exercise, I only had the materials of the website to work with at the time.  I asked a few classmates to look over the USDA website on their own and share their pain points with me about how it could be better or more intuitive.  The scope broadened considerably as I delved down deeper into the USDA website and found older versions of the website buried inside its existing tree structure, which also contained a lot of pertinent information that a user of the website may wish to access.
Problem Statement
The USDA - a study in parts.  The utility of the case study was to redefine its structure to bring attention to the most pressing information forward where someone would not have to hunt for it.
Target Users
For the purpose of this exercise I was able to identify that the user of USDA website is literally John Q. Public, to denote a hypothetical member of society deemed a "common man.”  I could not find a more apt or specific entity who would be using the USDA website apart from that.  From research heuristics done on USDA.gov I determined that people go there for disaster relief resources, information on food recalls, information on applying for food assistance, and for defining a number of terms related to agriculture and energy.
Process & What I Did
I started with a card sort.  The USDA website current structure has 18 main topics, each of which contain main subtopics that link internally to current, or older, editions of the USDA website.  For the purpose of creating a mockup of a new structure, I arranged the 18 topics down into 6 more general topics, under the belief that adding an extra tier to the opening tree structure would allow John Q. Public the option to start with a more indirect ‘why’ he was on the USDA website and then provide a list of subcategories that would further refine his search.  I then moved to drawing mockups on paper, then creating an Adobe XD wireframe before moving into Hifi XD mockups.  I made two rounds of these before submitting to User Testing with my classmates.  Later I made changes and iterated the design decisions made from user feedback.
User Testing + Outcomes
Overall I got a huge amount of feedback and insight into my design choices from my classmates.  They were able to see the layouts I made for the USDA and give me valuable insights for where my choices of font, spacing, headings and so forth faltered.  I created a website with hero images (which USDA has since updated their website to be width-spanning borderless hero images as well on their actual website) but I often seemed to place text in less-than-intuitive places over the top of the images.  I structured a user test that consisted of someone looking for plant-related diseases and where to source more information.  However in this outcome I discovered a unique bias that I made myself when creating and structuring the layout: I put plants under Food.  I assumed that, given the scenario where one is growing a garden, that those tested would search for Plants under Food, but only 3 out of 7 thought first to look there.  Upon further pressing for clarification, the other 4 did not instinctively correlate plants to food production, and thus from there the rest of the test was brought into question.  I didn’t precisely learn what I wanted because the scope and depth of the USDA website grew as I kept studying it
Lessons Learned
I would not have chosen the USDA website if I had spent more time studying how deep the rabbit hole actually goes.  AMS, ARS, Plants, APHIS, APHID, MOOR, and many others are all directly part of the USDA website and are further buried informational structures inside of the already dense collection of USDA topics.  My card sort eventually grew to over a hundred cards before I stopped to reign it in.  I would ask specific questions of people going to the USDA website as it currently exists, as opposed to asking classmates and friends to look over the website and tell me what they thought of it.  What I did learn, however, was to make a better layout in XD than what I had been doing, and I learned the importance of iterating on design layouts after the first round of testing.  Ultimately the user testing feedback made for better-looking mobile and desktop layouts, and I would like to iterate them further in the future to refine more content from the USDA.
Future Opportunities
I would like to greatly improve user testing.  If I had more time I would make more trees in the mockup to better express the possible paths to receiving information on the USDA website.  With HTML and CSS styling I would like to see if there is a way to at least consistently show all the information that USDA offers across its myriad of websites and subheadings.
