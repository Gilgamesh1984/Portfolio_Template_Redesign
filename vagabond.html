<h3>Travel App Case Study</h3>

<p>Vagabond was born of a concept project that means to explore the possibilities of the open road.  The primary goal of the project was to acquaint myself with the rigors of UX research, so the end product reflects my results.  The consistent theme in my research was that my participants were not motivated by commercial endeavors or tourism but sought travel as a way to encapsulate unique moments of experience.</p>
<hr>

<h3>Team Size + Role & Responsibility</h3>
<p>My goal was to become acquainted best with the process of design thinking.  This was a solo project so I cannot account for team members.  I did a lot of it out of order, as I would later realize.  I was product management, UX researcher, interviewer, and designer.  I used a Miro board to organize my thoughts, make affinity diagram of the results of the interviews, and used XD to make lofi and hifi wireframes.  </p>

<h3>Timeline & Scope </h3>
<p>This was a two-week project that used available resources that I had such as the Adobe Creative Suite, Miro, Trello, inVision studio, and others.  I started first with the interviews but that later stymied me - I should have taken longer to organize the scope of what the project would become before I decided on the particular tack I would take with my interview questions.  </p>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Being able to participate in lesser-known sites or activities in countries that are not often visited by the average tourist.  Find the Road Less Traveled.  To further index traffic, travel patterns, and activity in the world as an analysis for how people choose to travel.  The purpose of which is to provide travelers an increased awareness of their potential recreational and social opportunities, while curating the ephemeral ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ feeling that many travel experiences aspire to obtain.</p>


<h3>Target Users</h3>
<p>For this case study I made an amalgam of the five people I interviewed, and named him Frank Chalmers.  I determined from him that he was looking for cheap, culturally-enriching experiences in domestic and foreign locations.  Favorite activities are exploring ‘cities without an end’ like Tokyo or Mexico City.  Thrifty, environmentally conscious, and more likely than most other travelers to be carrying a backpack on his shoulders.</p>

<h3>Process & What I Did</h3>
<p>I began interviewing friends who were closest to me in both relationships and proximity.  All of them had done some traveling but I was able to summarize their feelings and insights into an empathy map, which I later used to draw parallels and conclusions about the project.  I transfered that into the difficult part (first time out) of making and organizing wireframes into a hypothetical application.  Through trial and error, I was able to make the login screen and several pieces of what would constitute the search process for the application.</p>

<h3>User Testing + Outcomes</h3>
<p>I shared what I had done with several of the people I interviewed.  It was very barebones and we acknowledged that.  However, of the men I interviewed they admitted to only using websites, not apps, to make arrangements and decisions based on their travel before so the application still would have its intended use.  They noted they would most likely use the map functions of the trails section, which was able to pull trail guides based on location GPS data.  </p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>So many lessons were learned through this process.  First, I was able to understand user flow and how it may be used to order screens and processes within an app.  I also used Adobe XD to make something for the first time.  I iterated the product several times and would like to iterate it more.  Initially I was caught up in the minutiae of what I was doing that I found it difficult to make any headway.  There were numerous blunders along the way but I slowly corrected them myself and when I did them again I found that the process worked much faster the second or third time.   </p>

<h3>Future Opportunities</h3>
<p>I want to go back to this and really make a better looking Hifi product that would better reflect the improved design fundamentals I’ve learned since originally doing this assignment.  I look forward to being able to have a better idea of these processes and how to better myself in design programs in the future.  I understand XD more now but definitely will improve as time goes on.</p>
